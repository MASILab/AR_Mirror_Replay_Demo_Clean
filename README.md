# AR_Mirror_Replay_Demo_Clean
Clean replay demo for the Adventure Science Center (Summer 2019)
Done:
1. New code structure and recording algorithm
2. Automated record and replay
3. Only renders the first player detected by Orbbec
4. Elapsed time display
5. Three rounds of replay

Need to do:
# 1. Need to fix the issue when player steps out of camera's fov the recorder stops recording
   # Most likely caused by transform.Find() after the gameobject gets destroyed
2. Bone rendering
3. Extra joint object in the middle of the screen?
4. Juggling/Kicking videos
